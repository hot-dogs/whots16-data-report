[*Hydrographic observations at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution Hawaii
Ocean Time-Series Site (WHOTS): 2019-2020, Data Report 16*](http://whots16-data-report.readthedocs.io/)

## Abstract

In 2003, [Robert Weller](https://www.whoi.edu/profile/rweller/) ([Woods Hole
Oceanographic Institution [WHOI]](https://www.whoi.edu))
, [Albert Plueddemann](https://www.whoi.edu/profile/aplueddemann/) 
([WHOI](https://www.whoi.edu)), and
[Roger Lukas](http://www.soest.hawaii.edu/oceanography/faculty/rlukas/)
([The University of Hawaii [UH]](https://manoa.hawaii.edu)) proposed to establish 
a [long-term surface mooring at the Hawaii Ocean Time-series (HOT)](http://www.soest.hawaii.edu/whots/)
[Station ALOHA (22°45’N, 158°W)](https://hahana.soest.hawaii.edu/stationaloha/)
to provide sustained, high-quality air-sea fluxes and the associated upper
ocean response as a coordinated part of the HOT program, and as an element of
the global array of ocean reference stations supported by the National Oceanic
and Atmospheric Administration’s (NOAA) Office of Climate Observation. 

The WHOTS-16 mooring was deployed on October 6, 2019, during an eight-day 
cruise ([WHOTS-16 cruise](http://www.soest.hawaii.edu/whots/wh16_dep.html)) 
and was recovered on August 28, 2021, during an eight-day cruise 
([WHOTS-17 cruise](http://www.soest.hawaii.edu/whots/wh17_dep.html)). 
The cruises were aboard the NOAA Oscar Sette. The seventeenth mooring was 
deployed on August 26, 2021, during the 
[WHOTS-17 cruise](http://www.soest.hawaii.edu/whots/wh17_dep.html) and was 
recovered on July 25, 2022. 

This report documents and describes the oceanographic observations made on the 
WHOTS-16 mooring for nearly one year and ten months and from shipboard measurements
during the two cruises when the mooring was deployed and recovered. 
[Sections II](https://whots-annual-report.readthedocs.io/projects/whots16-data-report/en/latest/2_section.html) 
and [III](https://whots-annual-report.readthedocs.io/projects/whots16-data-report/en/latest/3_section.html) 
include a detailed description of the cruises and the mooring, respectively. 
Sampling and processing procedures of the hydrographic casts, thermosalinograph, 
and shipboard ADCP data collected during these cruises are described in
[Section IV](https://whots-annual-report.readthedocs.io/projects/whots16-data-report/en/latest/4_section.html). 
[Section V](https://whots-annual-report.readthedocs.io/projects/whots16-data-report/en/latest/5_section.html) 
includes the processing procedures for the data collected by the moored 
instruments: SeaCATs, MicroCATs, Moored ADCPs and VMCM. Plots of the resulting 
data and preliminary analysis ar presented in [Section VI](https://whots-annual-report.readthedocs.io/projects/whots16-data-report/en/latest/6_section.html).
