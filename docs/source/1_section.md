# Introduction


In 2003, Robert Weller (Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution [WHOI]), Albert Plueddemann (WHOI), and Roger Lukas 
(the University of Hawaii [UH]) proposed to establish a long-term surface mooring at the Hawaii Ocean Time-series (HOT) 
Station ALOHA (22°45'N, 158°W) to provide sustained, high-quality air-sea fluxes and the associated upper ocean response
as a coordinated part of the HOT program, and as an element of the global array of ocean reference stations supported by
the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s (NOAA) Office of Climate Observation.

With support from NOAA and the National Science Foundation (NSF), the WHOI HOT Site (WHOTS) surface mooring has been 
maintained at Station ALOHA since August 2004. This project aims to provide long-term, high-quality air-sea fluxes as a
coordinated part of the HOT program and contribute to the goals of observing heat, freshwater, and chemical fluxes at a 
site representative of the oligotrophic North Pacific Ocean. The approach maintains a surface mooring outfitted for 
meteorological and oceanographic measurements at a site near Station ALOHA by successive mooring turnarounds. 
These observations are being used to investigate air-sea interaction processes related to climate variability and change.

The original mooring system is described in the mooring deployment/recovery cruise reports
{cite}`Plueddemann2006, Whelan2007`. Bri, a Surlyn foam surface buoy is equipped with meteorological 
instrumentation including two complete Air-Sea Interaction Meteorological (ASIMET) systems 
\parencite{Hosom1995, Colbo2009} , measuring air and sea surface temperatures, relative humidity, barometric pressure, 
wind speed and direction, incoming shortwave and longwave radiation, and precipitation. Complete surface meteorological 
measurements are recorded every minute, as required to compute air-sea fluxes of heat, freshwater, and momentum. 
Each ASIMET system also transmits hourly averages of the surface meteorological variables via the Argos satellite system
and iridium. The mooring line is instrumented to collect time series of upper ocean temperatures, salinities, and 
velocities with the surface forcing record. This mooring includes conductivity, salinity and temperature recorders, 
two Vector Measuring Current Meters (VMCMs), and two Acoustic Doppler current profilers (ADCPs). See the WHOTS-15 mooring 
diagram in the  \ref{fig:whots_digram}.

The subsurface instrumentation is located vertically to resolve the temporal variations of shear and stratification in
the upper pycnocline to support the study of mixed layer entrainment. Experience with moored profiler measurements near
Hawaii suggests that Richardson's number estimates over 10 m scales are adequate. Salinity is crucial to water mass 
stratification, as salt-stratified barrier layers are observed at HOT and in the region (Kara et al., 2000). 
Thus Sea-Bird MicroCATs with vertical separation ranging from 5-20 m were used to measure temperature and salinity. 
A Teledyne RD Instruments (TRDI) ADCP obtains current profiles across the entrainment zone and another in the mixed layer.
Both ADCPs are in an upward-looking configuration, one is at 125 m, using 4 m bins, and the other is at 47.5 m using 2 m 
bins. To provide near-surface velocity (where the ADCP estimates are less reliable), we deploy two VMCMs. 
The simple mooring design is a balance between resolving extremes versus the typical annual cycling of the mixed layer 
(see {cite}`Plueddemann2006`; Santiago-Mandujano et al., 2007)
