# WHOTS (16-17) Cruise Shipboard Observations

````{admonition} OLD TEXT!
:class: warning

The hydrographic profile observations made during the WHOTS cruises were
obtained with a Sea-Bird CTD package with dual temperature, salinity, and
oxygen sensors. This CTD was installed on a rosette-sampler with 5 L Niskin
sampling bottles for calibration water samples. Furthermore, the Hi’ialakai and
Oscar Sette came equipped with a thermosalinograph system that provided a
continuous depiction of the near-surface layer's temperature and salinity.
Horizontal currents over the depth range of 30-700 m were measured from the
shipboard 75 kHz Ocean Surveyor
(OS75) ADCP (narrowband) with a vertical resolution of 16m for the WHOTS-15 and
WHOTS-16 cruises. Broadband mode for the OS75 provided additional current data
over the range upper 200 m with a vertical resolution of 8m.

Data gaps occurred when the system was shut down temporarily during
communications with the acoustic releases used for the moorings during both
cruises. Periods of missing data between 300 and 450 m in the broadband ADCP
were apparent due to the lack of scattering material in the water.

## Conductivity, Temperature, and Depth (CTD) Profiling

```{admonition} OLD TEXT!
:class: warning

Continuous measurements of temperature, conductivity, dissolved oxygen, and
pressure were made with the UH Sea-Bird SBE-9/11Plus CTD underwater unit #91361
(BETA), deck unit 112060 during WHOTS-15 and WHOTS-16 cruises. The CTD was
equipped with an internal Digiquartz pressure sensor and pairs of external
temperature, conductivity, and oxygen sensors.

Each temperature-conductivity sensor pair used a Sea-Bird TC duct, which
circulated seawater through independent pump and plumbing installations. The
CTD configuration also included two oxygen sensors, installed in the plumbing
for each sensor set. In both cruises, the CTD was mounted in a vertical
position in the lower part of a rosette sampler, with the sensors' water
intakes located at the bottom of the rosette.

The package was deployed on a conducting cable, which allowed for real-time
data acquisition and display. The deployment procedure consisted of lowering
the package to approximately 10 dbar and waiting until the CTD pumps started
operating. The CTD was then raised until the sensors were close to the surface
to begin the CTD cast. The time and position of each cast were obtained via a
GPS connection to the CTD deck box. Four salinity samples were taken on each
cast for calibration of the conductivity sensors.

### Data Acquisition and Processing

````{admonition} OLD TEXT!
:class: warning 

CTD data were acquired at the instrument's highest sampling rate of 24 samples
per second. Digital data were stored on a laptop computer, and, for redundancy,
the analog signal was recorded on VHS videotapes. Backups of CTD data were made
onto USB storage cards.

The raw CTD data were quality controlled and screened for spikes described in
the WHOTS Data Report 1 (Santiago-Mandujano et al., 2007). Data alignment,
averaging, correction, and reporting were done as described in Tupas et al. (
1993). Spikes in the data occur when the CTD samples the disturbed water of its
wake. Therefore, the downcast samples were rejected when the CTD was moving
upward or when its acceleration exceeded 0.5 m s-2 in magnitude. The data were
subsequently averaged into 2-dbar pressure bins after calibrating the CTD
conductivity with the bottle salinities.

The data were additionally screened by comparing the T-C sensor pairs. These
differences permitted the identification of problems with the sensors. The data
from only one T-C pair, whichever was deemed most reliable, is reported here.
Only data from the downcast are reported, as wake effects from the rosette
commonly contaminate upcast data.

Temperature is reported on the ITS-90 scale. Salinity and all derived units
were calculated using the UNESCO (1981) routines; salinity is reported in the
Practical Salinity(SA) scale (PSS-78). Oxygen is reported in umol kg-1.

### CTD Sensor Calibration and Corrections

#### Pressure

````{admonition} OLD TEXT!
:class: warning 

The pressure calibration strategy for CTD pressure transducer SN 75434 used
during WHOTS-15 and WHOTS-16 cruises employed a high-quality quartz pressure
transducer as a transfer standard. Periodic recalibrations of this lab standard
were performed with a primary pressure standard. The only corrections applied
to the CTD pressures were a constant offset determined when the CTD first
enters the water on each cast. Also, a span correction determined from bench
tests on the sensor against the transfer standard was applied. These procedures
and corrections are thoroughly documented in the HOT-2018 data report (Fukieki
et al., 2020).
````

#### Temperature/Conductivity

````{admonition} OLD TEXT!
:class: warning 
Sea-Bird SBE-3-Plus temperature and SBE 4C conductivity transducers were used
during WHOTS-15 and -16 cruises. These sensors' history and performance have
been monitored during HOT cruises, and calibrations and drift corrections
applied during WHOTS cruises are thoroughly documented in the HOT-2018 data
report (Fukieki et al., 2020).
````

#### Dissolved Oxygen

````{admonition} OLD TEXT!
:class: warning 
Sea-Bird SBE-43 oxygen sensors were used during the WHOTS-15 and -16 cruises.
The WHOTS-15 oxygen data were calibrated using calibration coefficients
obtained during the HOT-305 cruise conducted on 9-13 September 2018, before the
WHOTS-15 cruise, which used the same oxygen sensors. The CTD empirical
calibration was performed using oxygen water samples and the procedure from
Owens and Millard Jr (1985). See Tupas et al. (1996) for details on these
calibrations procedures. Similarly, the oxygen data from WHOTS-16 were
calibrated using calibration coefficients obtained during the HOT-315 cruise
conducted on 3-7 September 2019, before the WHOTS-16 cruise, which used the
same oxygen sensors.

## Water Sampling and Analysis

### Salinity

````{admonition} OLD TEXT!
:class: warning 
Salinity samples were collected by a rosette sampler during CTD casts at
selected depths during WHOTS-15 and -16, and then sub-sampled in 250 ml glass
bottles. The top of each bottle and thimble were thoroughly dried before being
tightly capped to prevent water from being trapped between the cap or thimble
and the bottle’s mouth. It has been observed that residual water trapped in
this way increases its salinity due to evaporation, and it can leak into the
sample when the bottle is opened for measuring. Samples from each cruise were
measured after the cruise in the UH laboratory using a Guildline Autosal
8400B (SN 70168). IAPSO standard seawater samples were measured to standardize
the Autosal, and samples from a large batch of “secondary standard” (
substandard) seawater were measured after every 24-48 samples to detect drift
in the Autosal. Standard deviations of the secondary standard measurements were
less than ± 0.002 for WHOTS-15 and -16 cruises (Table IV 1).

The substandard water was collected by a rosette sampler from 1020 m at station
ALOHA during HOT cruises and drained into a 50-liter Nalgene plastic carboy. In
the laboratory, the water was then thoroughly mixed in a glass carboy for 20
minutes by manually shaking, rolling, and tilting the carboy vigorously, after
which a 2-inch protective layer of white oil was added on top to deter
evaporation. The substandard water was allowed to stand for approximately three
days before it was used and was stored in the same temperature-controlled room
as the Autosal, protecting it from the light with black plastic bags to inhibit
biological growth. Substandard seawater batches #65, and #66 were prepared on
October 23rd, 2018, and December 21st, 2018, respectively, and were used for
WHOTS-15 and -16 samples, respectively.

Samples from the WHOTS-15 and WHOTS-16 cruises were measured during the same
day as the HOT-306 and HOT-316 samples, respectively. Table IV 1 shows the
precision measurements of the secondary sub-standards.

## Thermosalinograph Data Acquisition and Processing

### WHOTS-16 Cruise

````{admonition} OLD TEXT!
:class: warning 
Near-surface temperature and salinity data during the WHOTS-15 cruise were
acquired from the thermosalinograph (TSG) system installed on the NOAA Ship
Hi’ialakai. The Hi’ialakai has a water intake depth of 2 m located at the
ship's bow, next to the starboard side bow thruster. The sensors located in the
ship’s wet lab about 67 m from the intake were sampling water from the
continuous seawater system running through the ship. They were comprised of one
thermosalinograph model SBE-21 (SN 3155) and a micro-thermosalinograph model
SBE-45 (SN 0150), both with (internal) temperature and conductivity sensors;
and an SBE-38 (SN 0215) external temperature sensor located at the water
intake. The SBE-21 recorded data every 5 seconds, and the other two instruments
recorded data every second. The system had a pressure gauge showing a flow
pressure between 10 to 15 psi when the water intake was open. Both
thermosalinograph systems had a de-bubbler.
````

#### Temperature Calibration

````{admonition} OLD TEXT!
:class: warning 
External temperature data from the SBE-38 sensor (last calibrated at Sea-Bird
on January 16th, 2018) were used to measure the seawater temperature. These
data were compared to the data collected during CTD casts.
````

#### Nominal Conductivity Calibration

````{admonition} OLD TEXT!
:class: warning 
Data from the SBE-21 conductivity and temperature sensors were used to
calculate the intake seawater salinity. These sensors were last calibrated at
Sea-Bird on November 8th, 2017. All conductivity data from the
thermosalinograph were nominally calibrated with coefficients from this
calibration. However, all the final salinity data reported here were calibrated
against bottle data, as explained below.
````

#### Data Processing

````{admonition} OLD TEXT!
:class: warning 
Daily files containing navigation data recorded every second were concatenated
with the thermosalinograph data. The thermosalinograph data were then screened
for gross errors, with upper and lower bounds of 18 °C and 35 °C for
temperature and 3 and 6 Siemens m -1 for conductivity. There were no points
outside the valid temperature range and no points outside the valid
conductivity range.

A 5-point running median filter was used to detect one- or two-point
temperature and conductivity glitches in the thermosalinograph data. Glitches
in temperature and conductivity detected by the 5-point median filter were
immediately replaced by the median. Threshold values of 0.3 °C for temperature
and 0.1 Siemens m-1 for conductivity were used for the median filter. After
running the filter, there were no temperature or conductivity points replaced
by the median. A 3-point triangular running mean filter was used to smooth the
temperature and conductivity data after passing the glitch detection.

The thermosalinograph aboard the Ship Hi’ialakai was set to record data every
five seconds. However, occasionally, due to an error in the acquisition
software rounding routine, a record is written at a longer interval. There were
no timing errors during WHOTS-15.

Data were visually scanned to flag spikes likely caused by contamination due to
the introduction of bubbles to the flow-through system during transits or rough
conditions. Of 799,508 data points, 22,555 conductivity data points (2.8%) were
flagged as bad.
````

#### Bottle salinity and CTD Salinity Comparisons

````{admonition} OLD TEXT!
:class: warning 
The thermosalinograph salinity was calibrated by comparing it to bottle
salinity samples drawn from a water intake next to the thermosalinograph every
8 hours throughout the cruise. Of the 22 thermosalinograph bottles sampled,
bottle 17 was identified as a conductivity outlier and discarded from the
analysis. Samples were analyzed as described in Section IV.B. The comparison
was made in conductivity to eliminate the effects of temperature. The
conductivity of each bottle sample was computed using the salinity of the
bottle, thermosalinograph temperature, and a pressure of 3.44 dbar, which
includes the pressure of the flow-through system’s pump.

Salinity samples were drawn from the flow-through system, located less than 0.5
m from the SBE-21. Consequently, there should be virtually no delay between
when the water passes through the thermosalinograph and sampled. A 90-second
average centered on the sample draw time was chosen for processing purposes.

In order to make the comparison in conductivity units, the CTD conductivity was
calculated using the 4 dbar downcast CTD salinity, the internal
thermosalinograph temperature, and a pump pressure of 3.44 dbar. There were 12
CTD casts conducted during WHOTS-15 while the thermosalinograph was running.
Casts 1 and 4 were removed from the analysis as temperature outliers and cast
1, 9, and 10 as conductivity outliers.

A cubic spline was fit to the time series of the differences between the bottle
and TSG conductivity, and a correction was obtained for the TSG conductivities.
Salinity was calculated using these corrected conductivities, the
thermosalinograph temperatures, and 3.44 dbar pressure. After correction, the
mean difference between the bottle and thermosalinograph salinities was
0.000005 psu with a standard deviation of 0.003339 psu. The mean CTD -
thermosalinograph difference was -0.001385 psu with a standard deviation of
0.001677 psu.

#### CTD Temperature Comparisons

````{admonition} OLD TEXT!
:class: warning 
There were 12 CTD casts conducted during WHOTS-15, one of which was a test cast
offshore Honolulu (Station 20) and five at Station 52 (WHOTS-14), and six at
Station 50 (WHOTS-15), respectively. The 4 dbar downcast CTD temperature data
from those casts were used to compare with the thermosalinograph data at the
time of the casts. This comparison gives an estimate of the quality of the
thermosalinograph measurements. Of the 12 casts, two were identified as
temperature outliers after comparing it against the thermosalinograph data and
removed from the analysis. The mean difference between the CTD and the internal
temperature sensor was -0.00992 °C, with a standard deviation of ± 0.04096 °C.

### WHOTS-17 Cruise

````{admonition} OLD TEXT!
:class: warning 
Near-surface temperature and salinity data during the WHOTS-16 cruise were
acquired from the thermosalinograph (TSG) system installed on the NOAA Ship
Oscar Sette. The sensors were sampling water from the continuous seawater
system running through the ship. They were comprised of one thermosalinograph
model SBE-21 (SN 3168) and a micro-thermosalinograph model SBE-45 (SN 0290),
both with (internal) temperature and conductivity sensors located in the ship’s
chemistry lab, about 70 m from the hull intake; and an SBE-38 (SN 266) external
temperature sensor located at the entrance of the water intake. All instruments
recorded data every second. The water intake is located at the ship's bow,
forward from the starboard side bow thruster at a depth of 3 m. The system has
a flow meter in the chemistry lab, showing a flow rate of about 1.1
liters/minute during the cruise. Only the SBE-45 has a debubbler. Salinity
water samples were taken every 8 hours from the exhaust in the Chemistry lab
using 0.25-liter glass bottles, to be measured in the UH lab to correct any
drift in the thermosalinograph conductivities.

The thermosalinograph aboard the Ship Oscar Sette was set to record data every
second. The system had to be secured on the last day of the cruise due to the
bad weather because it kept shutting down due to air going into the plumbing,
causing the pumps to stop working.

Data were visually scanned to flag spikes likely caused by contamination due to
the introduction of bubbles to the flow-through system during transits or rough
conditions. Of 69,311,136 data points, 141,365 conductivity data points (2%)
were flagged as bad.

#### Bottle salinity and CTD Salinity Comparisons

````{admonition} OLD TEXT!
:class: warning 
The thermosalinograph salinity was calibrated by comparing it to bottle
salinity samples drawn from a water intake next to the thermosalinograph every
8 hours throughout the cruise. Of the twenty-one thermosalinograph bottles
sampled, bottle #18, #19, #20, and #21 were identified as a conductivity
outlier and were discarded from the analysis. Samples were analyzed as
described in Section IV.B. The comparison was made in conductivity to eliminate
the effects of temperature. The conductivity of each bottle sample was computed
using the salinity of the bottle, thermosalinograph temperature, and a pressure
of 10 dbar, which includes the pressure of the flow-through system’s pump.

Salinity samples were drawn from the flow-through system, located less than 0.5
m from the SBE-45. Consequently, there should be virtually no delay between
when the water passes through the thermosalinograph and sampled. A 90-second
average centered on the sample draw time was chosen for processing purposes.

In order to make the comparison in conductivity units, the CTD conductivity was
calculated using the 4 dbar downcast CTD salinity, the internal
thermosalinograph temperature, and a pump pressure of 10 dbar. There were
twelve CTD casts conducted during WHOTS-16 while the thermosalinograph was
running. Casts 4, 5, 6, 7, and 9 were removed from the analysis as temperature
and conductivity outliers.

A cubic spline was fit to the time series of the differences between the bottle
and TSG conductivity, and a correction was obtained for the TSG conductivities.
Salinity was calculated using these corrected conductivities, the
thermosalinograph temperatures, and ten dbar pressure. After applying
corrections, the mean difference between the bottle and thermosalinograph
salinities was -0.00004 psu with a standard deviation of 0.001886 psu. The mean
CTD - thermosalinograph difference was -0.0028 psu with a standard deviation of
0.001118 psu.
