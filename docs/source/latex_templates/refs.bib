   abstract = {The accuracies of the meteorological sensors (air temperature, relative humidity, barometric pressure, near-surface temperature, longwave and shortwave radiation, and wind speed and direction) that compose the Improved Meteorological (IMET) system used on buoys at long-term ocean time series sites known as ocean reference stations (ORS) are analyzed to determine their absolute error characteristics. The predicted errors are compared to in situ measurement discrepancies and other observations (direct flux shipboard sensors) to confirm the predictions. The meteorological errors are then propagated through bulk flux formulas and the Coupled Ocean-Atmosphere Response Experiment (COARE) algorithm to give predicted errors for the heat flux components, the freshwater flux, and the momentum flux. Absolute errors are presented for three frequency bands [instantaneous (1-min sampling), diurnal, and annual]. The absolute uncertainty in the annually averaged net heat flux is found to be 8Wm-2 for conditions similar to the current ORS deployments in the subtropics. © 2009 American Meteorological Society.},

   abstract = {The recently developed IMET (improved meteorology) system for ships and buoys and the key elements of the program that led to its development are described. The system improves the ability to measure mean meteorological variables, including wind velocity, barometric pressure, incoming shortwave and longwave radiation, air temperature, sea surface temperature, humidity, and precipitation, from both types of platforms. Extensive laboratory and field tests of a variety of sensors were conducted to investigate and document their stability, accuracy, and reliability. Modular electronics were developed so that each sensor in the system communicated digitally, returning calibrated values to a central data recorder. IMET systems have been deployed on buoys in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans and on research vessels. The history of the program, reasons for the choice of the present sensor suite, the design of the sensor modules, a description of the data acquisition system, and examples of data collected with the system are described. A discussion of the areas in which further improvements to the system will be sought is also provided.},

@article{Kara2000,
   abstract = {Seasonal variability in the isothermal and isopycnal surface mixed layers of the North Pacific Ocean is examined using the Naval Research Laboratory Ocean Mixed Layer Depth (NMLD) Climatology. A comparison with observations from 11 ocean weather stations in the northeast Pacific Ocean is performed that validates the NMLD climatology in this region. The general features of the isothermal layer depth (ILD) and mixed layer depth (MLD) obtained from these mixed layers are explained with wind stress, surface net heat flux, and freshwater flux climatologies, given guidance from a mixed layer model. Departures from a surface-forced interpretation of turbulent mixing are found near the Kuroshio, where horizontal heat transport is important. The much deeper ILD in the northeast Pacific in winter and spring relative to the MLD reveals a 50 m "barrier layer" between the bottom of the MLD and the top of the thermocline. A detailed analysis shows this barrier layer extends over most of the North Pacific subpolar gyre. It forms when the seasonal thermocline is deepened in winter by surface cooling, such that salinity stratification due to evaporation minus precipitation less than zero (E - P < 0) becomes important in the formation of the MLD. A shallower halocline forms over the subpolar gyre than in other regions of the North Pacific because of precipitation dominating over evaporation in the annual mean. A mechanism for maintaining the shallow halocline is provided by upward vertical motion driven by positive wind stress curl in the presence of diapycnal mixing. Numerical models show this as part of a shallow meridional overturning cell. Copyright 2000 by the American Geophysical Union.},

This report documents recovery of the WHOTS-1 mooring, deployed in August 2004 near 22.75°N, 158°W, and deployment of the WHOTS-2 mooring at the same site. Both moorings were outfitted with Air-Sea Interaction Meteorology (ASIMET) systems to measure, record, and transmit the surface meteorological variables necessary to compute air-sea fluxes of heat, moisture and momentum. In cooperation with R. Lukas of the University of Hawaii, the upper 155 m of the moorings were outfitted with oceanographic sensors for the measurement of temperature, conductivity and velocity. The WHOTS mooring turnaround was done on the Scripps Institution of Oceanography Ship Melville, Cruise TUIM-10MV. The cruise took place between 23 and 30 July 2005.},
